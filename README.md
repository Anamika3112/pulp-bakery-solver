This project uses Python's "PULP" library to solve a Linear Programming (LP) problem to maximize profit in a bakery.

##  Objective Function


##  Constraints

- Oven usage: 5* x1 + x2 <= 90
- Food processor: x1 + 10* x2 <= 300
- Boiler: 4* x1 + 6* x2 <= 125

## How to Run

pip install pulp
python bakery.py

## Description

In this project, I used Python’s PuLP library to solve a linear programming problem that helps a bakery maximize its profit. The goal was to determine how many units of two different bakery items—Bowdoin logs and chocolate cakes—the bakery should produce while staying within resource limits like oven time, food processor usage, and boiler capacity. I defined the objective function to maximize profit and added constraints based on the available resources. Using PuLP, I formulated and solved the problem, and the output showed the optimal number of each item to produce and the maximum possible profit. This task helped me understand how optimization works in real-life business situations and how to implement linear programming in Python using a simple and effective approach.
